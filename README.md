# Cruise Management App | Yang Yan 233440C

This Node.js module is a simple menu-driven cruise booking system designed for managing cruises, customers, and bookings.  
It allows users to:
- Create cruise trips with names, ship types, routes, prices, and schedules.
- Create customer profiles with personal and emergency contact details.
- Book a cruise for an existing customer.
- Retrieve lists of all cruises, customers, and bookings.

## Setup Instructions
Export the json files to MongoDB.
Or you can choose not to, but you cannot book any cruise trips without cruises and customers.
